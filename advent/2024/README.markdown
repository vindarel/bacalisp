# Advent of code 2024

notes

I usually use my CIEL package, to get libraries out of the box, and to
run the .lisp files as a script from the terminal (not that IÂ do it,
just to demo).

- day 01: remind that gethash gets a default value. `dolist` and `&aux` is concise (reddit).
- day 02: not brute force, at most 3 more attemps per item. A loop-y solution and a functional-y one inspired by others.
- day 03: using a PEG grammar https://github.com/ravi-delia/uclp
